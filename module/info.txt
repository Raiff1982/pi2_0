Explanation of the Module Script
Advanced Models: Uses BERT for sentiment analysis to leverage advanced contextual embeddings.
Sarcasm Detection: Placeholder function for sarcasm detection, which would require a specific dataset and model.
Negation Handling: Improved negation detection by tagging words following negation terms.
Contextual Embeddings: Uses BERT embeddings for better context understanding.
Domain-Specific Models: Placeholder function for training domain-specific models.
Data Quality Enhancement: Functions for data cleaning and augmentation.
Multimodal Data: Placeholder function for analyzing multimodal data (text, image, audio).
Regular Updates: Function to update models with new data.
Ensemble Methods: Combines multiple models (TextBlob, VADER, BERT) for better accuracy.
Evaluation and Fine-Tuning: Function to evaluate and fine-tune models using cross-validation.
