### Detailed Example Scripts

#### `privacy_consent.py`

```python
import tkinter as tk

def show_privacy_consent():
    def on_accept():
        user_consent.set(True)
        root.destroy()

    def on_decline():
        user_consent.set(False)
        root.destroy()

    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("Data Permission and Privacy")

    message = ("We value your privacy. By using this application, you consent to the collection and use of your data "
               "as described in our privacy policy. Do you agree to proceed?")
    label = tk.Label(root, text=message, wraplength=400, justify="left")
    label.pack(padx=20, pady=20)

    button_frame = tk.Frame(root)
    button_frame.pack(pady=10)

    accept_button = tk.Button(button_frame, text="Accept", command=on_accept)
    accept_button.pack(side="left", padx=10)

    decline_button = tk.Button(button_frame, text="Decline", command=on_decline)
    decline_button.pack(side="right", padx=10)

    user_consent = tk.BooleanVar()
    root.mainloop()

    return user_consent.get()
